        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <h3>For the Marinade</h3>
            <ul>

                <li>2 tsp garlic powder</li>
                <li>1/2 tbsp fish sauce</li>
                <li>1 1/2 tsp pepper</li>
                <li>1 tsp chicken bouillon powder</li>
                <li>1/4 tsp salt (or to taste)</li>
            </ul>
        <h3>For the Sauce</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>10 cloves garlic (2 left whole, the rest finely chopped)</li>
                <li>1 sprig spring onion (chopped)</li>
                <li>4 chili (optional)</li>
                <li>3 red shallot (finely chopped)</li>
                <li>4 tbsp brown sugar</li>
                <li>3 tbsp fish sauce</li>
                <li>6 tbsp oil (2 tbsp for frying the chopped garlic, 4 for browning the red shallots)</li>
                <li>3 tbsp lime juice</li>
                <li>4 tbsp water</li>
            </ul>
        <h3>For the Batter</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>1/2 US cup corn starch</li>
                <li>1/2 tsp baking powder</li>
                <li>cooking oil (for frying)</li>
            </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Marinate the chicken in the garlic powder, chicken bouillon powder, pepper, salt and fish sauce for 20 minutes minimum. Alternatively, make it ahead of time to marinate overnight.</li>
                <li>
                    <p>Using a low heat, add the chopped garlic to 2 tbsp cooking oil and let it fry until golden.</p>
                    <p><strong>Tip:</strong> It may be tempting to turn the heat up for a quicker brown, but this could run the risk of burning the garlic. It's best to keep the temperature low and steady.</p>
                </li>
                <li>Use a zip lock bag to shake and coat the marinated wings in the starch mixture.</li>
                <li>Pour the chicken into a colander to shake off any excess.</li>
                <li>
                    <p>Add oil into a deep pan or wok and fry the wings on a medium heat for 5 minutes on each side or until lightly golden brown and cooked. </p>
                    <p>Set aside to drip dry in a sieve over a bowl.</p>
                </li>
                <li>Bring the heat back up to high and fry the wings for a second time for 2 minutes or until they develop a deeper golden color. Transfer onto a sieve to drip dry or on a plate lined with paper towels.</li>
                <li>Use a mortor and pestle to mash the garlic and chili, then set aside as you work on the sauce.</li>
                <li>Pour 4 tbsp oil in a saucepan and brown the red shallots. Add in the sugar, fish sauce, garlic, chili and water to caramelize for 15 minutes or until it reaches a thick consistency, then stir the lime juice and spring onions in.</li>
                <li>Mix the fried wings back into the sauce and toss until all are coated.</li>
                <li>Stir in the fried chopped garlic until well combined.</li>
                <li>Serve immediately as is!</li>
